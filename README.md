This is why this organisation exists now.

* Internal level editor!
* 3d-Engine via OpenGL
* GLSL-Shaders
* Joystick/Gamepad support

# What have I already done to improve the game?
* Migrated to CMake
* Separated data and code repos with auto ZIP
* Fixed few warnings
* Removed `using namespace std;`
* Made code C++17 compatible (no either warnings or errors)

# What will/should be done?
Check out [TODO list](TODO.md)!

# How can I take part in fun and make cubosphere great again?
