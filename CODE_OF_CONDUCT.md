## Hi there! I hate political language, so I'll just speak as normal person.

Just follow few rules, be fine and have a nice day:

1. Do constructive things and not useless ones. It's place for building great game and not anything else.  
Visit our FreeNode channel if you want to discuss not-that-code-related things, or use other communication systems, 
like Jabber, IRC PM or voice via air.
2. Be ok about any constructive critics, it is so damn important! It, however, should not violate rule #3.
3. Don't be rude even if your opponent is COMPLETE IDIOT. If they violate rule #1, write to vyo@vallua.ru.
4. Be honest about things you can't, we'll find anyone better at them.

Enjoy collaboration!
